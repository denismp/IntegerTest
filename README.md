# IntegerTest
According to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html the ArrayList inherits from the Collection interface.

java.util
Class ArrayList<E>
•	java.lang.Object
•	java.util.AbstractCollection<E>
•	java.util.AbstractList<E>
•	java.util.ArrayList<E>
All Implemented Interfaces: Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, List<E>, RandomAccess  Direct Known Subclasses: AttributeList, RoleList, RoleUnresolvedList

Given that this is the case, the Collection I use is a java.util.ArrayList.

The code is pasted below and the STS project that will run it is attached to the email as zip file.  Please look for it.

This java application implements a reverse bubble sort.  It uses the Integer Object to store each integer.

I have run this and it prints the value 9, which is the second largest integer value in the list that is created in the main() method.
